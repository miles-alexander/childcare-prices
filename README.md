# National Childcare Prices Analysis ðŸ’°

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the rising costs of childcare in the United States, highlighting geographic disparities and the financial strain on low-income families. Using data from the **U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s National Database of Childcare Prices**, the analysis explores how factors such as location, age group, and provider type influence childcare costs over multiple years (2008â€“2018).

The goal is to provide insights for policymakers, advocacy groups, and stakeholders to address the childcare affordability crisis through informed decision-making and policy interventions.

## Objectives
- Uncover geographic and economic factors affecting childcare costs.
- Highlight trends and disparities in childcare pricing.
- Advocate for policy changes to alleviate the burden on families.
- Inform stakeholders of the challenges and potential solutions.

---

## Data Summary
The dataset includes:
- Childcare prices across U.S. states and counties.
- Variables: state names, county names, median household incomes, poverty rates.
- Costs for various age groups (infants, toddlers, preschoolers) across provider types: Family Child Care (FCC) and Childcare Centers (CCC).
- Data spans from 2008 to 2018, allowing for longitudinal analysis.

### Data Handling and Assumptions
- Missing data for Indiana and New Mexico led to their exclusion.
- Missing values were imputed using state averages to maintain trends.
- Data is assumed to be adjusted for inflation for consistent year-over-year comparisons.

## Key Findings
1. **Geographic Disparities:** 
   - Significant regional differences in childcare costs.
   - Rural areas generally have lower costs compared to metropolitan regions.
   - Notable differences between states, with the Northeast being the most expensive.

2. **Trends Over Time:**
   - Consistent increase in childcare costs from 2008 to 2018.
   - Costs for infants and toddlers are higher compared to preschoolers.
   - Family Child Care (FCC) is generally more affordable than Childcare Centers (CCC).

3. **Economic Impact:**
   - Even states with lower costs, such as Mississippi, struggle with affordability due to high poverty rates.
   - Rising costs disproportionately affect low-income families.

## Mediums of Communication
To effectively convey the findings, the project uses three main mediums:
1. **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:** 
   - Explore childcare prices by state and provider type.
   - Apply filters to examine specific trends and regional variations.

2. **Infographic:**
   - Visual representation of key findings, such as the most and least expensive states.
   - Highlights economic disparities in a simplified format.

3. **PowerPoint Presentation:**
   - Structured for policymakers, presenting detailed analysis and policy recommendations.
   - Combines visual elements with data-driven insights.

### Design Considerations:
- Clear labeling and color-coding to differentiate high-cost and low-cost regions.
- Use of bar charts, line graphs, and maps to present data succinctly.
- Accessible visual format to accommodate varied audiences.

## Target Audience
1. **Policymakers and Government Officials:**
   - Understand the regional impact of childcare costs.
   - Explore policy interventions to improve affordability.

2. **Parent Advocacy Groups:**
   - Use insights to advocate for more accessible and affordable childcare solutions.
   - Mobilize community support for policy changes.

## Ethical Considerations
- The dataset is public and free from legal constraints, but careful handling is necessary to avoid misrepresentations.
- All transformations and imputation methods are documented to ensure transparency.
- Assumptions are clearly stated to prevent misleading interpretations.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Early exploration of the dataset could have streamlined the analysis.
- Translating raw data into meaningful visualizations was rewarding, highlighting the potential for data to inform impactful policy changes.
